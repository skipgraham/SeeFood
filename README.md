# SeeFood

Swift 5

Super over-simplified version of the SeeFood app on HBO's Silicon Valley. Uses CoreML and the Inception V3 image recognition model. 

The only thing, of course of you watch the show, that it does right now is recognize whether the image it is analyzing is a hotdog, or not. It's not fool-proof but the IV3 model is decently suited to see hotdogs apparently.

This was just a simple experiment to tiptoe into CoreML and Vision APIs.
